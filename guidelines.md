### Guidelines for Authors

_(To be defined.)_


### Guidelines for Reviewers

Reviews consist of the following parts described below.


##### Overall recommendation

- **Accept.** The article is accepted as is, or minor presentation, grammatical, or spelling problems raised in review must be addressed by the authors and verified by the editorial and publication team.
- **Undecided.** Authors must revise their manuscript to address specific concerns before a final decision is reached. A revised manuscript will be subject to second round of peer review in which the decision will be either Accept or Reject and no further review will be performed.
- **Reject.** The work cannot be published based on the lack of interest, lack of novelty, insufficient conceptual advance or major technical and/or interpretational problems.


##### Summary

Briefly summarize key problems, approach, results, and claims of the article. 


##### Significance

Is the significance of the problem area clearly stated and compelling? In other words, what evidence is provided that the problem area is of importance? Who will be interested in reading the paper, and why? Is the paper likely to be one of the ten most significant papers published in the discipline this year?


##### Novelty

Are the claims appropriately discussed in the context of previous literature? Identify published work that challenges the claimed novelty. 


##### Clarity

Is the manuscript well written? Does it use language that is undefined or unfamiliar to the reviewer? Do the figure or table legends clearly communicate the nature and contents of the figure or tables? 
Identify awkward phrases, as well as spelling and grammatical errors.

##### Soundness

Is the approach valid? Are the use of statistics and treatment of uncertainties correctly handled? Are there any aspects of the approach that could compromise the integrity of the study?

##### Reproducibility

Could the work be reasonably reproduced by similarly qualified individual or group? Are the resources used in the study available to others to replicate their findings? Are the data and software openly available, or is there an appropriate rationale for why they cannot be made available (such as privacy issues)? If the data or software are not directly available, is there a clear mechanism for obtaining these? Do the data or software reuse standards? 
Data and software used are versioned

##### FAIRness

Have the authors made efforts to make their resources maximally FAIR - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable - in line with the published FAIR principles?

##### Suggested improvements

Reviewers are required to provide concrete suggestions as to how the authors can improve their work and directly address raised concerns. This can include new experiments, use of other datasets, comparison with other work, a different statistical evaluation, etc.
