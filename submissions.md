### Submissions

We will be open for submissions soon (early 2017).


##### Research Papers

We accept as main category research papers that report on original research. Results previously published at conferences or workshops may be submitted as extended versions.


##### Position Papers

We accept position papers presenting discussions and viewpoints around Data Science topics. These papers do not need an evaluation, but need to present relevant and novel discussion points in a thorough manner.


##### Survey Papers

We also publish survey papers of the state of the art of topics central to the journal's scope. Survey articles should be comprehensive and balanced, and should have the potential to become well-known introductory and overview texts.
