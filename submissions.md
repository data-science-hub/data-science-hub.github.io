### Submissions

We will be open for submissions soon, probably some time in the second half of 2016.


##### Research (12 pages)

Reports on original research. Results previously published at conferences or workshops may be submitted as extended versions. These submissions will be reviewed along the usual dimensions for research contributions which include originality, significance of the results, and quality of writing.


##### Position Papers

_(To be defined.)_


##### Surveys (16 pages)

Solicited and unsolicited surveys of the state of the art of topics central to the journal's scope. Survey articles should have the potential to become well-known introductory and overview texts. These submissions will be reviewed along the following dimensions: (1) Suitability as introductory text, targeted at researchers, PhD students, or practitioners, to get started on the covered topic. (2) How comprehensive and how balanced is the presentation and coverage. (3) Readability and clarity of the presentation. (4) Importance of the covered material to the broader Data Science community.
